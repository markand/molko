/**
 * \file mlk/core/sprite.h
 * \brief Image sprites
 *
 * The sprite is a module to help rendering a large image that is split into
 * individual parts. This improves memory usage as several images are loaded in
 * a unique one instead of individual parts.
 *
 * \note The image may not contain space, margins or padding within each cell.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * To use a sprite, fill up the required fields in ::mlk_sprite and then call
 * ::mlk_sprite_init which will calculate the number of rows and columns
 * available in the image.
