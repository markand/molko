/**
 * \file mlk/core/vfs.h
 * \brief Virtual file system abstraction.
 *
 * This module offers an abstract interface to load files and perform read/write
 * operation on them. This can be useful for games that are designed to load
 * large assets from compressed archives.
 *
 * The molko frameworks comes with two implementations:
 *
 * | module             | support     | remarks                            |
 * |--------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|
 * | mlk/core/vfs-dir.h | read, write | opens file relative to a directory |
 * | mlk/core/vfs-zip.h | read        | zip archive files extractor        |
 *
 * ## Opening mode
 *
 * Both VFS interfaces and function can take a `const char *` mode argument to
 * indicate user open mode. Each implementation can take specific interface
 * options but the following are reserved and must be understood by each:
 *
 * - `e`: start writing at end
 * - `r`: open for reading
 * - `t`: truncate file (can't be used without `w`)
 * - `w`: open for writing (create file but keep content if exists)
 *
 * Mode `e` is meaning less when combined with `t`.
 *
 * \note In contrast to C `fopen` function, modes can be mixed which means `r`,
 *       `w` and `rw` means read-only, write-only and read-write respectively.
 *
 * ## Initialize a VFS
 *
 * To use this module, you must first open a VFS interface. It is usually
 * implemented using the ::MLK_CONTAINER_OF macro.
 *
 * Example with mlk/core/vfs-dir.h
 *
 * ```c
 * struct mlk_vfs_dir dir;
 *
 * mlk_vfs_dir_init(&dir, "/usr/share/mario");
 * ```
 *
 * The abstract interface will be located in the `vfs` field for each
 * implementation.
 *
 * ## Opening files
 *
 * Once your VFS module is initialized, you can call ::mlk_vfs_open to load an
 * entry from it:
 *
 * ```c
 * struct mlk_vfs_file *file;
 * char content[1024];
 * size_t len;
 *
 * file = mlk_vfs_open(&dir.vfs, "block.png", "r");
 *
 * if (!file)
 *     your_handle_failure_function();
 *
 * // The function does not append a NUL terminator.
 * len = mlk_vfs_file_read(file, content, sizeof (content) - 1);
 *
 * if (len == (size_t)-1)
 *     your_handle_failure_function();
 *
 * // Use content freely...
 * ```
 *
 * ## Cleaning up resources
 *
 * Opened files SHOULD be destroyed before the VFS itself because depending on
 * the underlying implementation, it is possible that those opened files have
 * direct references to the VFS module.
 *
 * ```c
 * mlk_vfs_file_finish(file);
 * mlk_vfs_finish(&dir.vfs);
 * ```
